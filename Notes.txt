MAC: Media Access control
	- Permanent
	- Physical
	- Unique 
	- Every network device has a MAC address, assinged by the Machine Manufacturer.
	- used to identify devices and transfer data between them
	- each packet in network has
		- source MAC
		- destination MAC
		
Changing MAC address:
	- increases anonymity  
	- impersonate other devices
		- bypass filters
		- access restricted data
		
Practical:

1. Use 'ifconfig' command to to list all network interfaces on our device and their network properties(including IP and MAC address)
[if command not found use: 'sudo apt-get install net-tools' and try 'ifconfig' again]
	ifconfig

2. Disable the network interface of which you want to change MAC address of:
	ifconfig 'network interface name' down
	
3. We want to modify the option 'ether' which contains the MAC address of the interface:
	ifconfig 'network interface name' hw ether 'new MAC address'
	
4. Enable the interface:
	ifconfig 'network interface name' up
	
5. Check the MAC address again of the network interface using 'ifconfig':
	ifconfig
	
Example:

1:	ifconfig
2:	ifconfig wlp3s0 down
3:	ifconfig wlp3s0 hw ether 11:22:33:44:55:66
4:	ifconfig wlp3s0 up
5:	ifconfig

We are making a python program that will do all this for us with extra features. For that we want python to execute linux commands and for that we use a module called 'Subprocess'.

Subprocess can execute linux as well as all system commands.
It contains no. of functions which allow us to execute system commands(respective to OS).

Sytnax:
	import subprocess
	subprocess.call("COMMAND", Shell = true)
